The coding exercise should be performed in Python 3 as a part of SDS challenge for Trustpage. The task is to develop an unsupervised method that can determine whether a movie review is positive or negative. The labels provided in the data set is used to evaluate your method.

# Introduction
Sentiment analysis, also popularly known as opinion analysis or opinion mining. The key idea is to use techniques from text analytics, NLP, Machine Learning, and linguistics to extract important information or data points from unstructured text. This in turn can help us derive qualitative outputs like the overall sentiment being on a positive, neutral, or negative scale and quantitative outputs like the sentiment polarity, subjectivity, and objectivity proportions.

# Problem Statement
The main objective is to predict the sentiment for several movie reviews obtained from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews that have been pre-labeled with “positive” and “negative” sentiment class labels based on the review content.
